# todoapp-FE
Frontend (Backbone js) code of the todo application

Clone the code to your local machine.

After cloning, it is suggested that you perform a fresh install of the node modules using "npm i" or "npm install".

Once completed, open the terminal on your IDE and start the server using **http-server -p 8000**. This will start the application at **localhost:8000**.

**NOTE: The cors configuration on backend has allowed requests from port 8000 so starting the frontend at this port wont require you to make any extra modifications**

Once the server starts and the main page loads at localhost:8000, you can see the todolist fetched from the database and then you can perform operations accordingly.(Add, Update, Delete)
